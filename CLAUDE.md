# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Singapore FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) + Property + Investment Retirement Planner. A fully client-side web application for comprehensive retirement planning tailored to Singapore residents.

**Status:** W7 complete. Fully client-side app with Monte Carlo simulation (Web Worker), 6 withdrawal strategies, historical backtesting, sequence risk stress testing, dashboard, property analysis, scenario comparison, and reference guide.

**Current Phase: W8 — Deploy**
Update this marker as phases complete.

**Source of truth:** When the master plan (`FIRE_PLANNER_MASTER_PLAN_v2.md`) and this file conflict, the master plan wins for calculation logic, formulas, Singapore-specific rules, and domain requirements. This file wins for technology choices, architecture decisions, and implementation patterns.

## Architecture

### Frontend
| Dependency | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| React | 18.3.x |
| TypeScript | 5.7.x |
| Vite | 6.x |
| React Router | 6.x |
| Zustand | 5.x |
| React Query (TanStack Query) | 5.x |
| Tailwind CSS | 3.4.x |
| shadcn/ui | latest |
| Recharts | 2.x |
| D3.js | 7.x |
| React Hook Form | 7.x |
| Zod | 3.x |
| TanStack Table | 8.x |

**Routing:** React Router v6 with `createBrowserRouter`. Route components live in `pages/` as plain components (e.g., `ProfilePage.tsx`). Do NOT use Next.js file-based routing conventions (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx` in nested folders).

**State:** 6 Zustand stores (profile, income, allocation, simulation, withdrawal, property). Dashboard metrics are **derived hooks**, not a 7th store — the dashboard owns no state, it computes views from other stores.

### Simulation Engine (Web Worker)

All heavy computation (Monte Carlo, backtest, sequence risk, SWR optimization) runs in a Web Worker (`lib/simulation/simulation.worker.ts`) to avoid blocking the UI. No backend server required.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lib/math/linalg.ts` | Cholesky decomposition, covariance matrix, matrix ops |
| `lib/math/random.ts` | SeededRNG (xoshiro128**), Box-Muller gaussians |
| `lib/math/stats.ts` | Percentile, Student-t quantile |
| `lib/simulation/monteCarlo.ts` | 10K MC simulations (parametric/bootstrap/fat-tail) |
| `lib/simulation/backtest.ts` | Bengen-style rolling window historical backtest |
| `lib/simulation/sequenceRisk.ts` | Crisis scenario stress testing |
| `lib/simulation/swrOptimizer.ts` | Binary search for safe withdrawal rate |
| `lib/simulation/simulation.worker.ts` | Web Worker message handler |
| `lib/simulation/workerClient.ts` | Worker client + strategy params flattening |
| `lib/exportExcel.ts` | Client-side Excel export via exceljs |
| `lib/data/historicalReturnsFull.ts` | 97 rows historical returns (1928-2024) |

### Data Persistence (Browser-Only)

All user financial data stays in the browser. No server-side storage of user data.

- **localStorage:** All Zustand store state auto-saved on change via `zustand/middleware` persist. Restored on page load.
- **JSON export/import:** Users can download their full state as a JSON file and restore it on any device/browser. This is the cross-device portability mechanism.
- **URL params:** Life stage, FIRE type, and view state encoded in URL for bookmarking and sharing specific views.
- **No authentication.** No accounts. No server-side anything.

## Computation Architecture

All computation is client-side. Heavy computations (Monte Carlo, backtest, sequence risk, SWR optimization) run in a **Web Worker** (`lib/simulation/simulation.worker.ts`) to avoid blocking the UI. Lightweight computations (FIRE number, tax, CPF, income projections, portfolio stats, deterministic withdrawal strategies, property analysis) run on the main thread for instant feedback.

### Web Worker Communication

The 3 simulation hooks (`useMonteCarloQuery`, `useBacktestQuery`, `useSequenceRiskQuery`) call worker functions from `workerClient.ts` instead of API endpoints. `workerClient.ts` manages a lazy singleton Worker instance with message ID multiplexing for concurrent calls. `useMutation` from TanStack React Query is retained for `isPending`/`error`/`data` state management.

### Withdrawal Strategies

The 6 withdrawal strategies are implemented in TypeScript (`lib/calculations/withdrawal.ts`) and used by both the deterministic comparison view and the simulation engines (MC, backtest, sequence risk). There is one implementation — no cross-language parity concern.

### Rebalancing

All simulations (MC, backtest, sequence risk) use **annual steps**. The rebalancing frequency option in the UI (Annual/Semi-Annual/Quarterly) is informational — it does not change simulation granularity. Historical return data is annual, and sub-annual rebalancing has negligible impact on long-term outcomes. Do not implement sub-annual simulation steps.

## Validation Layer

Validation runs **before** any calculation. Invalid inputs must not propagate through the store dependency chain.

### Per-Store Validation (Zod schemas in `lib/validation/schemas.ts`)
Each store has a Zod schema defining valid ranges. Examples:
- `currentAge`: integer, 18-100
- `retirementAge`: integer, > currentAge, <= lifeExpectancy
- `lifeExpectancy`: integer, > retirementAge, 50-120
- `swr`: number, 0.01-0.10
- Allocation weights: array of 8, each 0-1, sum === 1.0
- `annualExpenses`: number, > 0
- `inflation`: number, 0-0.15

### Cross-Store Validation (in `lib/validation/rules.ts`)
Rules that span stores:
- Retirement age (profile) > current age (profile)
- Life expectancy (profile) > retirement age (profile)
- Allocation weights (allocation) must sum to 1.0 before portfolio stats compute
- Income streams end ages (income) <= life expectancy (profile)
- Withdrawal strategy params (withdrawal) validated against portfolio size (profile)

### Error Propagation
- Each store exposes a `validationErrors` field (map of field name to error message)
- Calculation hooks check upstream store validity before computing: if profile store has errors, income projections return `null` with an error flag
- Components display inline validation errors on inputs and show a warning banner when downstream calculations are blocked by upstream errors
- Simulation runs are gated: Monte Carlo button is disabled with tooltip explaining which inputs need fixing

## Key Domain Concepts

- **8 asset classes:** US Equities, SG Equities (STI), Intl Equities (MSCI), Bonds, REITs, Gold, Cash, CPF (OA+SA blend)
- **6 withdrawal strategies:** Constant Dollar (4% rule), VPW, Guardrails (Guyton-Klinger), Vanguard Dynamic, CAPE-Based, Floor-and-Ceiling
- **3 salary models:** Simple (fixed growth), Realistic (career phases + promotion jumps), Data-Driven (MOM benchmarks)
- **Monte Carlo methods:** Parametric (multivariate normal via Cholesky), Historical Bootstrap, Fat-tail (Student-t df=5)
- **All values in SGD.** USD-denominated assets converted at user-specified or historical FX rates.
- **Singapore-only.** All tax, CPF, property, and regulatory logic is Singapore-specific. No multi-country support. Data files in `lib/data/` are structured as standalone modules (e.g., `taxBrackets.ts`, `cpfRates.ts`) so future locale support could swap implementations, but do not build abstraction for it now.

## Singapore-Specific Logic

All Singapore-specific values live in `lib/data/` files, never hardcoded in calculation functions.

- **CPF:** Contribution rates vary by age bracket (up to 55: 37% total; 55-60: 29.5%; 60-65: 20.5%; 65-70: 16.5%; >70: 12.5%). OW ceiling $6,800/month, AW ceiling formula. Extra interest on first $60K (extra 1% on first $30K OA, extra 1% on next $30K across OA/SA/MA). BRS/FRS/ERS projections with 3.5% annual growth.
- **Tax:** SG progressive income tax (0% on first $20K up to 24% above $1M). Personal reliefs (earned income, NSman, spouse, child, parent, CPF, SRS). SRS deduction cap $15,300/yr.
- **Property:** Bala's Table for leasehold decay, BSD rates (1% on first $180K, 2% on next $180K, 3% on next $640K, 4% on next $500K, 5% on next $1.5M, 6% on remainder), ABSD rates by residency/property count, 75% LTV.
- **CPF LIFE:** Estimated payout rates ~5.4% (Basic) / ~6.3% (Standard) of FRS at 55.

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend: Vitest
Unit tests for every function in `lib/calculations/`:
- `fire.test.ts` — FIRE number, years-to-FIRE, Coast FIRE, Barista FIRE with known-good reference values from the master plan
- `cpf.test.ts` — Contribution calculations at each age bracket, extra interest rules, OW/AW ceiling logic, BRS/FRS/ERS projections
- `tax.test.ts` — Progressive tax at each bracket boundary, reliefs, SRS deduction
- `income.test.ts` — 3 salary models with expected output at specific ages, income stream aggregation
- `portfolio.test.ts` — Markowitz return/volatility/Sharpe for known allocation weights
- `withdrawal.test.ts` — All 6 strategies with deterministic inputs and expected year-by-year output
- `property.test.ts` — Bala's Table decay, BSD/ABSD calculations, LTV

Property-based tests (using `fast-check`):
- FIRE number > 0 when annual expenses > 0 and SWR > 0
- Allocation weights always sum to 1.0 after normalization
- Years to FIRE >= 0
- Tax payable <= taxable income
- CPF contributions <= salary x max total rate

Validation tests:
- Each Zod schema rejects out-of-range values
- Cross-store rules catch invalid combinations

Simulation engine tests (`lib/simulation/` and `lib/math/`):
- `linalg.test.ts` — Cholesky decomposition, covariance matrix construction, matrix multiplication
- `random.test.ts` — SeededRNG determinism, Box-Muller gaussian distribution, seed reproducibility
- `stats.test.ts` — Percentile matching NumPy, Student-t quantile accuracy
- `monteCarlo.test.ts` — Seeded RNG for reproducible results. Success rate, percentile bands, terminal stats, all 3 methods (parametric/bootstrap/fat-tail), all 6 withdrawal strategies
- `backtest.test.ts` — Known historical periods with expected survival, rolling windows, 3 dataset modes, heatmap generation
- `sequenceRisk.test.ts` — Crisis return injection, 3 mitigations (bond tent, cash buffer, flexible spending), deterministic with seed
- `swrOptimizer.test.ts` — Binary search converges to expected SWR within tolerance, per-strategy rate key mapping

### Integration Tests
3 user journey scenarios with concrete expected values (derived from master plan formulas + smart defaults of 2.5% inflation, 0.3% expense ratio, Balanced 60/40 template at 7.2% nominal return):

1. **Fresh Graduate** (age 25, $48K income, $30K expenses, $50K NW, Aggressive 80/20, SWR 3.5%)
   - FIRE Number: $30,000 / 0.035 = **$857,143**
   - Savings Rate: $18,000 / $48,000 = **37.5%**
   - Years to FIRE (NPER at ~4.4% real net return): **~16 years (age 41)**
   - Coast FIRE Number: $857,143 / (1.044)^16 = **~$432,000** → not yet reached at $50K NW
   - Barista FIRE Income: max(0, $30,000 - $50,000 * 0.035) = **$28,250/yr**

2. **Mid-Career Professional** (age 35, $180K income, $96K expenses, $800K liquid + $200K CPF OA + $100K CPF SA, Balanced 60/40, SWR 4%)
   - FIRE Number: $96,000 / 0.04 = **$2,400,000**
   - Current NW: $800K + $300K CPF = $1,100,000
   - Progress: $1,100,000 / $2,400,000 = **45.8%**
   - Annual Savings: $180,000 - $96,000 = **$84,000**
   - Years to FIRE (NPER at ~3.9% real net return): **~12 years (age 47)**
   - Coast FIRE Number: $2,400,000 / (1.039)^12 = **~$1,524,000** → not yet reached
   - SG Tax (approx, $180K income - $37K CPF employee - $15.3K SRS - $20K reliefs = ~$107.7K chargeable): **~$12,300**

3. **Pre-Retiree** (age 55, $2M portfolio, $80K expenses, retirement at 58, Conservative 30/70, SWR 4%)
   - FIRE Number: $80,000 / 0.04 = **$2,000,000** → already at FIRE
   - Years to FIRE: **0** (already achieved)
   - Retirement Duration: 90 - 58 = **32 years**
   - Constant Dollar withdrawal: $2M * 0.04 = **$80,000/yr**
   - VPW withdrawal year 1 (PMT at 2% real, 32 years): **~$87,500/yr**
   - CPF LIFE at 65 (FRS ~$213K * 1.035^0 * 0.063 / 12 * 12): **~$13,400/yr**
   - Post-65 effective SWR: ($80K - $13.4K) / $2M = **3.33%** (reduced by CPF LIFE)

### Coverage Requirements
- `lib/calculations/`: 95% line coverage minimum
- `lib/simulation/`: 90% line coverage minimum
- `lib/math/`: 90% line coverage minimum
- `lib/validation/`: 90% line coverage minimum
- All tests must pass before committing

## Do Not

- **Do not use `any` type** in TypeScript calculation functions. All inputs and outputs must be typed.
- **Do not hardcode Singapore-specific values** in calculation functions. CPF rates, tax brackets, ABSD rates, Bala's Table data — all go in `lib/data/` files.
- **Do not use `Math.random()`** for Monte Carlo. Use `SeededRNG` from `lib/math/random.ts` for deterministic, reproducible simulations.
- **Do not call simulation functions on the main thread.** Always use the Web Worker via `workerClient.ts`.
- **Do not use Next.js conventions.** No `page.tsx` / `layout.tsx` nested folder routing. This is React Router v6 with Vite.
- **Do not create a dashboard Zustand store.** Dashboard metrics are derived hooks that read from other stores.
- **Do not add a backend server.** All computation runs client-side. No database. No authentication. Browser-only persistence.
- **Do not skip validation.** Every calculation hook must check input validity before computing.
- **Do not import from one store inside another store's definition.** Cross-store reads happen in hooks and components, not in store definitions.

## Development Commands

```bash
cd frontend && npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run type-check   # tsc --noEmit
npm run test         # Vitest (run all tests)
npm run test:watch   # Vitest in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Vitest with coverage report
```

### Before Committing
1. `npm run type-check` passes with zero errors
2. `npm run lint` passes
3. `npm run test` passes (all tests green)
4. `lib/calculations/` coverage >= 95%
5. No `any` types in calculation or simulation files
6. No hardcoded Singapore-specific values outside `lib/data/`

## UI Patterns

- **Live calculations:** Every input change recalculates client-side metrics instantly (no submit button for simple metrics).
- **Explicit run for heavy computation:** Monte Carlo and Backtest require a manual "Run" button with progress indicator. Show computation time on completion.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Basic mode shows essentials (age, income, expenses, net worth). Advanced toggles reveal income streams, life events, CPF details, correlation matrix, custom return overrides.
- **Color coding convention:** Blue = user input, Black = formula/computed, Green = linked from another store/section.
- **Smart defaults:** Pre-filled with Singapore defaults (age 30, $72K income from MOM degree median, $48K expenses, 2.5% inflation, Conservative template for Post-FIRE users).
- **Tooltips:** Every label has an (i) icon. Hover shows definition + formula.
- **Comparison mode (W7):** Save current state as named scenario, modify inputs to create alternatives, side-by-side panel. Up to 5 named scenarios stored in localStorage under `fireplanner-scenarios` key. Implemented as a utility module (`lib/scenarios.ts`), not a store.
- **Mobile-first responsive:** Dashboard cards stack vertically, charts resize with container, sidebar becomes bottom nav on mobile.

- **SG REITs pre-2002:** Use US REIT data as proxy
- **Correlation matrix:** Compute from overlapping years only; document year range used

### Data Format
- All historical data lives in `frontend/src/lib/data/` as TypeScript modules
- `historicalReturnsFull.ts` contains the full 97-row time series (1928-2024) used by MC bootstrap and backtest
- `historicalReturns.ts` contains summary stats (mean, stddev) per asset class
- `ASSET_KEY_TO_COLUMN` mapping bridges `ASSET_CLASSES` keys (`bonds`, `cpf`) to data column names (`usBonds`, `cpfBlended`)
- Each file includes a header comment with source URL, download date, and license
- Returns are annual, nominal, in local currency with a separate FX series for SGD conversion
- CPI values are decimal fractions (0.025 = 2.5%), NOT percentages

### Update Cadence
- Annual refresh in January with previous year's full-year data
- Update `historicalReturnsFull.ts` with new year's data row
- Recompute summary stats in `historicalReturns.ts` if needed

### Property Hybrid Monte Carlo (W7)
Property analysis is deterministic (formulas from the existing Excel model), but in W7, property scenarios are overlaid on MC results:
- 5 discrete property scenarios (Bull +6%, Base +3%, Stagnation +0.5%, Crash -15% Y1-2 then +2%, Asian Crisis -25% Y1-3 then +3%) weighted by probability
- For each MC simulation path, a property scenario is randomly assigned
- Property equity is added to the portfolio balance at each year
- Mortgage payments are deducted from annual savings (accumulation) or increase required withdrawals (decumulation)
- Rental income is added to post-retirement income streams
- This is a post-processing overlay on existing MC results
