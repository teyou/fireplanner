# SGFirePlanner Results Payload v2

This document is the canonical contract for the companion POST payload from Fireplanner to Expense.

- Producer: Fireplanner companion mode (`POST /api/planner/results`)
- Consumer: Expense companion bridge (`/api/planner/results` endpoint)
- Schema file: `docs/sgfireplanner-results-payload-v2.schema.json`

## Normative Definitions

### Failure
A simulation path fails at the first retirement year where the post-withdrawal/post-return portfolio balance is less than or equal to zero.

### fail_prob_0_5y
`count(paths with first failure year in retirement years 1..5) / n_simulations`

### fail_prob_6_10y
`count(paths with first failure year in retirement years 6..10) / n_simulations`

### p_success
`1 - (total_failed_paths / n_simulations)`

### wr_safe_95
Highest withdrawal rate that still gives approximately 95% success over the full retirement horizon (more conservative).

### wr_safe_90
Highest withdrawal rate that still gives approximately 90% success over the full retirement horizon (conservative).

### wr_safe_85
Highest withdrawal rate that still gives approximately 85% success over the full retirement horizon (moderate).

### wr_safe_50
Highest withdrawal rate that still gives approximately 50% success over the full retirement horizon (very aggressive).

## Required Validation Rules

- `0 <= p_success <= 1`
- `0 <= fail_prob_0_5y <= 1`
- `0 <= fail_prob_6_10y <= 1`
- `0 <= wr_safe_95, wr_safe_90, wr_safe_85, wr_safe_50 <= 1`
- If all WR fields are present: `wr_safe_95 <= wr_safe_90 <= wr_safe_85 <= wr_safe_50`
- If all terminal fields are present: `terminal_p5 <= terminal_p50 <= terminal_p95`
- If `allocation_weights` exists: sum of weights must be within `1.0 +/- 0.01`

## Historical Mapping (v1 -> v2 semantics)

| Legacy v1 field | v2 field |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | `schema_version` |
| `p_success` | `p_success` |
| `WR_critical_50` | `wr_safe_50` |
| `wr_critical_10` | `wr_safe_95` |
| `wr_critical_90` | `wr_safe_85` |
| `horizonYears` | `horizon_years` |
| `allocationSummary` | `allocation_summary` |
| `fire_age` | `projected_fire_age_p50` |
| `portfolio_at_fire` | `portfolio_at_fire_p50` |

This mapping is for migration reference only.

## Runtime Compatibility Policy

- Producer payload format is v2 only (`schema_version = 2`).
- Consumer accepts v2 only; non-v2 payloads are rejected.
- Do not emit legacy v1 alias keys in canonical payloads.
