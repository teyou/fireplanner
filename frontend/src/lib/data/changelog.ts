    title: 'Withdrawal Basis Toggle',
    description:
      'New toggle on all simulation and projection pages: choose between "My Expenses" (withdrawals match your planned spending) or "Custom Rate" (withdrawals based on portfolio × strategy rate, e.g. the 4% rule). Previously, changing SWR had no effect on results when expenses were set. A contextual hint nudges you to switch modes when adjusting rate-based strategy parameters in expense mode.',
    affectedSections: ['section-stress-test', 'section-projection'],
    insight:
      'In "Custom Rate" mode, a 3.9% SWR on a $5M portfolio withdraws ~$201K/year. In "My Expenses" mode, your actual planned spending (e.g. ~$99K/year) drives the withdrawal. The same portfolio can show 93.8% vs 100% success rate depending on which basis you use.',

    title: 'CPF OA mortgage shortfall now accounts for contributions',
    description:
      'The year-by-year projection was computing CPF OA mortgage shortfalls before adding your annual OA contributions, causing false shortfalls for employed users whose monthly contributions easily cover the mortgage. The housing deduction now runs after contributions, matching the real monthly co-flow of salary credits and mortgage debits.',
    affectedSections: ['section-cpf', 'section-projection'],
    insight:
      'In real life, CPF contributions and housing deductions both happen monthly. The old code deducted the full year\'s mortgage from the starting OA balance before adding any contributions, so someone with $11,500 OA and a $20,676/yr mortgage would show a $9,176 shortfall even though their $15,120/yr contributions more than cover it.',

Number, currency, and percentage inputs now show validation errors only after you leave the field, not while typing. Feature toggles upgraded to proper switch controls, checkboxes to shadcn components, and the ownership percentage slider to a proper slider control.',

Sequence Risk was missing post-retirement mortgage deductions and downsizing equity injections. Both engines now mirror projection.ts calculations exactly.',
    affectedSections: ['section-property'],
    insight:
      'For users with mortgages, the old MC would overestimate the retirement portfolio by ignoring cash mortgage payments during accumulation. For co-owned HDB properties, rental income was counted at 100% instead of the ownership share. A double-counting warning now appears if both HDB subletting and a rental income stream are active.',

    affectedSections: ['section-cpf'],
    insight:
      'With a static $79K cap, overflow to SA/RA/OA started too early in multi-decade projections, overstating retirement account balances. The growing BHS also means MA interest (4%) no longer overflows for under-65 members since BHS growth (4.5%) outpaces the interest rate.',

    description:
      'Employment income streams added after your retirement age (e.g., a lower-paying job from 45-55 in a Barista FIRE plan) were not generating CPF contributions even with "CPF Applicable" checked. CPF now correctly populates for any active employment stream regardless of your FIRE age.',

    description:
      'Income streams marked as "Tax-Exempt" were still being taxed. The tax calculation was hardcoded by stream type (rental and business always taxable, investment and government always exempt) instead of reading the tax treatment you selected. Now your tax treatment choice is the single source of truth for every stream type.',
    affectedSections: ['section-income'],
    insight:
      'This also means investment streams marked "Taxable" (e.g., foreign dividends) will now correctly be included in taxable income, and government streams marked "Taxable" will too. Previously the type-based hardcoding overrode your selection in both directions.',

    description:
      'The "CPF Applicable" toggle on employment income streams was being ignored. All employment income generated CPF contributions regardless of the setting. Now only streams with CPF Applicable enabled attract CPF contributions. Your primary salary always generates CPF when employer CPF is enabled.',
    affectedSections: ['section-income'],
    insight:
      'This matters for freelance or contract income added as employment streams. A $40K side income with CPF Applicable off was previously generating ~$14,800 in phantom CPF contributions, inflating your projected CPF balances by $600K+ over a career.',

    title: 'MediSave BHS overflow enforced on contributions and interest',
    description:
      'CPF MediSave (MA) is now capped at the Basic Healthcare Sum ($79,000). Mandatory contributions and interest that would push MA above BHS overflow to SA (pre-55), RA then OA (post-55 pre-LIFE), or OA (post-LIFE), matching CPF Board rules. Previously only voluntary top-ups were capped, causing SA/RA to be underfunded and CPF LIFE payouts underestimated.',
    affectedSections: ['section-cpf'],
    insight:
      'At age 30 with a $120K salary, MA receives ~$9,600/year in contributions. Without the cap, MA would reach $100K+ by age 33 instead of stopping at $79K. The excess now flows to SA at 4% interest instead of sitting in MA at 4%, which doesn\'t change interest earned but does increase the RA transfer at age 55, boosting CPF LIFE payouts.',

    affectedSections: ['section-cpf'],
    insight:
      'The allocation shift matters for projections: a 50-year-old gets 15% to OA vs 23% for someone under 35, meaning less OA available for housing but faster SA growth at the higher 4% interest rate.',
