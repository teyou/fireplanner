        <>
          <p>
            FIRE stands for <strong>Financial Independence, Retire Early</strong>. It means
            building enough savings and investments so your investment returns cover your living
            expenses indefinitely — freeing you from needing employment income.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            There are several flavours of FIRE (you'll choose one in the

            <li><strong>Regular FIRE</strong> — fully cover expenses from investments</li>
            <li><strong>Lean FIRE</strong> — minimal, frugal lifestyle expenses</li>
            <li><strong>Fat FIRE</strong> — comfortable or luxury-level expenses</li>
            <li><strong>Coast FIRE</strong> — enough invested that growth alone reaches your target</li>
            <li><strong>Barista FIRE</strong> — part-time work covers the remaining gap</li>

          <p>
            A guideline from William Bengen's 1994 study: if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio
            in year one and adjust for inflation each year, your money should last at least 30
            years.
